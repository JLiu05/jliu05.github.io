## Overview
So far, I have five documents documenting the work I have done based on two papers:  
> Roggeveen, J. V., & Stone, H. A. (2022). *Motion of asymmetric bodies in two-dimensional shear flow*.  
> *Journal of Fluid Mechanics, 939*, Article A23.  
> [https://doi.org/10.1017/jfm.2022.203](https://doi.org/10.1017/jfm.2022.203)
  
> Roggeveen, J. V., & Stone, H. A. (2025). *Drift of elastic hinges in quasi-two-dimensional oscillating shear flows*.  
> *Physical Review Fluids, 10*(3), 034401.  
> [https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevFluids.10.034401](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevFluids.10.034401)
 

The first paper derives the resistance tensors for an asymmetric particle in shear flow to describe the force and torque acting on the particle in terms of its motion.  
The second paper uses resistance tensors to derive dynamical equations describing the behavior of a symmetrical hinge-shaped body in flow.  

## My Work
- **Documents 1–3**: My attempt at re-deriving and explaining the reasoning behind the main equations in the two papers 
- **Document 4**: Details my method of trying to extend the methodology of the second paper to derive the dynamical equations describing an *n*-arm hinge, instead of just a two-arm one
- **Document 5**: (in progress) Attempt to verify my method by checking whether it can reproduce the equations in the second paper when *n* = 2
